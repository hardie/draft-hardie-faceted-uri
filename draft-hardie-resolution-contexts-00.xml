    <abstract>


<t>The effort to register .onion <xref target="RFC7686"/> in the IANA special names registry<xref target="RFC6761"/> has given rise to considerable discussion of how the namespace associated with the DNS relates to other namespaces used on the Internet.  A brief history of this has been set out in <xref target="I-D.lewis-domain-names"/>. This document focuses on the question of how to signal resolution context within a unified namespace that contains both DNS and non-DNS names.</t>

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>The history in <xref target="I-D.lewis-domain-names"/> and the usage in <xref target="RFC3986"/> both suggest that names registered in the domain name system are part of a larger set of Internet names.   If we model the system of Internet names as a set of directed graphs in an absolute naming context, following RFC 819 <xref target="RFC0819"/>, an Internet name is not necessarily a name in the domain name system, but is simply a unique name associated with that particular directed graph.  The resolution of the name, in other words, is independent from it being an “Internet name”.  The DNS is a common, but not the only, resolution context for Internet names.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="resolution-contexts" title="Resolution Contexts">

<t>The Domain Name System <xref target="RFC1034"/><xref target="RFC1035"/> provides the most common resolution system for Internet names by many orders of magnitude.  It has not, however, met all resolution requirements.  Multicast DNS <xref target="RFC6762"/> uses an alternative resolution service, as does TOR <xref target="TOR"/>.  Tor’s .onion names, in particular, appear to be effectively Internet names within a globally shared naming context; they simply happen to use an alternative resolution method.</t>

<t>The key practical question that follows from the existence of alternative resolution contexts is how you can determine whether or not a particular Internet name is part of the Domain name set of Internet names, or part of a different set.  The de facto signal we are using now is the top-most label of the Internet name.  If it is within the known set of DNS top-most labels, we have a definite yes.  If it is within an established set of non-DNS top-most labels, we have a definite no.</t>

<t>There are at least two unfortunate sets of potentially conflicting cases, where people are using labels with the intent to use this signal but have not risen to the level of “established no”.  In the first case, their usage may be mistaken for non-fully qualified names within the domain name system, resulting in the construction of a new Internet name where one was not intended (e.g. www.sld.allium becoming www.sld.allium.corp.example.com, rather than .allium being used as signal that this Internet name is not within the set of domain names).  The second case, which may overlap, is one in which the growth of the set of names in domain name system causes overlap (a new gTLD like .allium being assigned would conflict with the attempted use of .allium as a resolution context signal).</t>

<t>The risks of the two conflicting cases are pretty obvious, but despite that the use of a pseudo-TLD signal seems desirable to many setting up alternative resolution contexts.  It seems likely that this is because the services within the alternative resolution contexts wish to use protocols defined for DNS names as if they were defined for their Internet names.  The .onion example was driven, in other words, at least in part because its users wanted https://identifier.onion/ to work.  In order to share the HTTPS URI context, they needed to minimize the changes to the form of the URI.  That meant using https:// with a resolution trigger, rather than changing the URI (tor-https://, for example).</t>

<t>The implication for the universe of architecturally appropriate responses is that any means for signalling that a name is not within the DNS context but is still meant to be an Internet name must continue to allow those Internet names to be used in common protocol contexts.  It also means that any Internet name must expect restrictions to achieve that (viz. it must be a unique name within a directed graph within the overall Internet name namespace).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="available-alternatives" title="Available Alternatives">

<t>Given that restriction, the universe of possible resolution context signals seems to be limited.  One option is using a designated sub-tree of the Internet namespace for non-DNS resolutions, with labels within the tree indicating which resolution context is meant. <xref target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-alt-tld"/> describes one specific approach to this option.  While the use of this sub-tree may be esthetically less pleasing than a pseudo-TLD, it avoids the ambiguities which may arise during the development of alternative resolution context.</t>

<t>A second alternative is to fix either the set of top-level domains or the number of resolution contexts, so that ambiguity cannot occur.  While a fixed set of top-level domains might have seemed practical when the number of TLDs was limited to country codes and a strictly limited set of generic top-level domains, this has ceased to be a practical alternative.  Similarly, the creation of alternative resolution contexts cannot be effectively stifled, even were this desirable; those interested can implement and deploy them without registration of any kind.  That these may not interoperate or conflict with other deployments is, of course, a risk.</t>

<t>A third alternative within the DNS context is to continue the current registration of pseudo-TLDs and accept the consequences of ambiguity.  This will mean that conflicts between resolution context pseudo-TLDs and potential future TLDs must be managed and that the operational impact must be addressed.   A focus on deployment of mitigation strategies may reduce the operational consequences.  As an example, the deployment of loopback root zones <xref target="RFC7706"/> will reduce the impact of queries for pseudo-TLDs leaking to the root DNS name servers.  Similarly, policies for names registered as pseudo-TLDs may also limit potential conflict.</t>

<t>An alternative to signals within the DNS is making alternative signals easier.  URI registrations have gotten significantly easier<xref target="RFC7595"/> over time, but it might be possible to lower the bar further by creating a convention for using alternative resolution contexts.</t>

<t>As an example, we could set aside a string delimiter for this purpose as we set aside xn– to single out the ACE encoding for Internationalized Domain Names <xref target="RFC5891"/>.  That string delimiter could then be used to construct faceted URI schemes, one aspect of which contained the usual protocol indicator and the other the resolution context.  The ABNF for scheme is:</t>

<t>scheme      = ALPHA *( ALPHA / DIGIT / “+” / “-“ / “.” )</t>

<t>Setting aside a string delimiter such as +.+ would allow something like https://identifier.onion/ to become https+._tor//identifier/.  This would require updates to URI parsing libraries that intended to handle alternative resolution contexts, but the use of a common delimiter would lower the amount of code needed both to identify the core protocol and the alternative resolution contexts.  It might remain esthetically less pleasing, however, and it would prevent the use of IDNA-permitted characters as resolution context identifiers, something which the DNS-based solutions do allow.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="conclusions" title="Conclusions">

<t>There are clearly trade-offs among the available alternatives, as each has its own drawbacks as an indicator of resolution context.  Given, however, that the existence of multiple signals could generate even further interoperability issues and operational concerns, the creation of multiple signals is undesirable.  Any system which allows Internet names from alternate resolution contexts to be used in common protocol systems can likely be made to work, provided its drawbacks are accounted for and mitigated appropriately.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="security-considerations" title="Security Considerations">

<t>This document describes a number of potential method for establishing a resolution context for an Internet name.   Should the resolution context to be used with a name not be sufficiently clear, it may be possible to provide alternative information in a different context.  That alternative information could provide an avenue for an attacker to stand up services which would mimic those present elsewhere, allowing the attacker to subvert the connection, steal credentials,</t>
